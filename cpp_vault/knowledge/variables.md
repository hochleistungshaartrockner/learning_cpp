# Variables
atomic-summary:: "xxx"

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzaPdXTrSb8&t=1192s)

- in C++, the variable types need to be declared
```
int i = 1;
```
- always declare and initialize (assign value for first time) at the same time.
- if not initialized, you get a random number from the memory (garbage)
- use the keyword 'const' to prevent the value of a variable from changing.
```cpp
const int i = 2;
```

## Naming conventions
popular: Classes in PascalCase and variables in snake_case or camelCase
