# Learning C++

Welcome to "Learning C++", a repo, in which I, hochleistungshaartrockner, will document my journey of learning how to program in C++.
This might be a bit overpowered to document everything just for the purpose of learning a programming language, but since I am very forgetful and I do not want to keep in mind all of the details and resources, I will use this as my personal "library" to look back into when I eventually forgot something.

## How to use this vault
In order to be able to use this vault properly, here's a list of the plugins, that I installed:
- dataview
- advanced tables
- templater
- kanban
- tasks

## Structure
here's a list of topics, that I encountered while learning about C++:
```dataview
table knowledge-items as "Knowledge Items", lessons as "Lessons"
from [[]] and #moc
```
